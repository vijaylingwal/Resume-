      <li><strong>VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL SYSTEM USING RF AND GSM :</strong></li>
      <p>This project basically
deals with the speed control of vehicles at public places like hospitals, schools, colleges, etc
where the safety of people cannot be compromised and it is done by initially indicating the
driver about the approaching public area or by automatic ceasing of the speed via RF control.
There is a huge need to implement these kinds of safety measures as the safety is at utmost
priority in these kinds of areas.</p>
